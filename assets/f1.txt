Our Dabangg Girl Has A Lookalike And Her Pictures Are Sure To Blow Your Mind
Some call them lookalikes, while others call them doppelganger, either way, these are people who look very similar to each other.

It is said that each person has at least 6 lookalikes around the world.

Similarly, when one spots a lookalike of a Bollywood celebrity, it is bound to be the talk of the of the town.

One such case is of the Bollywood diva, Sonakshi Sinha.

Even we were when we saw her for the first time.

Kanika Arora is a New York-based make up artist and looks exactly like Sonakshi Sinha.

And guess what they have never met each other.

Is it just us or they really do have a similar taste in fashion too?

It is as if they take each other's advice on what to wear.

The jawlines of the two ladies match as well.

We are still wondering whether they are sisters who got separated in some fair or something?

Kanika Arora is very active on Instagram, under the username @beautybykanika.

Here she showcases her talent as a make up artist.

Just like Katrina Kaif's lookalike Zarine Khan and Aishwarya Rai's lookalike Sneha Ullal got a break in Bollywood, don't you think Kanika should try her hand in the film industry as well?

What if Kanika Arora walks in front of you?

Would you be able to tell the difference or you will fall into the trap of believing that it is Sonakshi Sinha?

There is no doubt that Sonakshi loves to wear a bindi and has often been seen wearing one both in movies and real life.

When her lookalike also sported the same accessory, man, it looked like Sonakshi's mirror image.

While Sonakshi has been seen as a reel life wife several times, Kanika, on the other hand is a real life wife who got married over a year ago.

Honestly, she looks like a diva already.

Even if we see her in Bollywood later, we think will rock it for sure.Did you like the story?
